# Combinatorial_analysis_calculations

Program that asks a user for two numbers, then asks for a choice of a calculation (permutation or combination)
to be performed and prints out the result.

An excercise from a Bjarne Stroustrup's "Programming Principles and Practice Using C++".
It may be upgraded for more calculations in the future.
